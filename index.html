        <summary>Machu Picchu</summary>
        <p>Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River valley.
            Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse
            huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and
            panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.</p>

        <summary>Chichen Itza</summary>
        <p>Chichén Itzá is a complex of Mayan ruins on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. A massive step pyramid, known as El
            Castillo or Temple of Kukulcan, dominates the ancient city, which thrived from around 600 A.D. to the 1200s.
            Graphic stone carvings survive at structures like the ball court, Temple of the Warriors and the Wall of the
            Skulls. Nightly sound-and-light shows illuminate the buildings' sophisticated geometry.</p>

        <p>Petra is a famous archaeological site in Jordan's southwestern desert. Dating to around 300 B.C., it was the
